## Minimal highlighting and deemphasized syntax

Tokyo Twilight only highlights 3 things: 

1. Definitions in <p style="color: #ffb37e; display: inline">orange.</p> 
2. Strings in <p style="color: #7ecaff; display: inline">blue.</p> 
3. Static constants in <p style="color: #7effb4; display: inline">green.</p> 

All other syntax is deemphasized to promote focus on content. This can be adjusted in settings.json if wanted:

```
"editor.tokenColorCustomizations": {
    "textMateRules": [
        {
            "name": "Punctuation",
            "scope": "punctuation",
            "settings": {
                "foreground": "#ebecf0"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
